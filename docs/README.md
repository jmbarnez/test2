# Novus Documentation Hub

Welcome to the Novus knowledge base. These documents capture the most important details for running, extending, and contributing to the project.

## Available Guides

- [Getting Started](./getting_started.md) — install prerequisites, run the game, and learn the project layout.
- [Architecture Overview](./architecture.md) — understand the major systems, state flow, and ECS wiring.
- [Content Pipeline](./content_pipeline.md) — learn how blueprints, items, and serialization fit together.
- [Controls & UX](./controls.md) — reference for keyboard, mouse, and UI interactions.

## Suggested Reading Order

1. Start with **Getting Started** to ensure your environment is ready.
2. Read **Architecture Overview** for a mental model of runtime behavior.
3. Use **Content Pipeline** when adding entities, ships, or data-driven content.
4. Keep **Controls & UX** handy during gameplay or when adjusting input bindings.

## Contributing Tips

- Follow the existing code style (see inline comments and Lua modules for examples).
- When adding new systems or components, update the relevant documentation so the docs stay in sync.
- If you introduce new game features or inputs, remember to refresh the controls and architecture guides.
